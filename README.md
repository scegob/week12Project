For week 12 of Promineo Tech, we have to build a basic crud application. A crud application is an application that you can create, read, update and delete. I decided to build a basic social media page that lets you create a post, look at the post, edit the post and delete the post. I would like to further improve on this project by adding an api.

The assignment asked for us to build this crud project follwoing these rules. 

a.	Use a form to add new entities

b.	Build a way for users to update or delete entities

c.	Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project
